# Simple Ambisonics Loudspeaker Distribution Finder

A simple webpage finding an optimal ambisonics loudspeaker setup in a half-sphere.
Always check the layouts after implementing them in your setup as there might be some that are not perfect.
Higher speaker density in front works for the time being mostly for horizontal layouts.

Certain speaker distributions are hardcoded instead of generative. 
You can find the function to generate the speaker setup in /src/function.tsx
